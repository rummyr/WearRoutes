Fixing heading view issues
1. releative layout so .. adding an attribute of
android:layout_below="@+id/heading" almost works except it has a gap
to android.support.wearable.view.WearableListView in preferencelist.xml

2a. releative layout so .. adding an attribute of
android:layout_alignParentStart="true"
to android.support.wearable.view.WearableListView in preferencelist.xml
works except heading scrolls off the page!

2b. commenting out    @Override public void onAbsoluteScrollChange(final int i) {
                          heading.setY(Math.min(-i, 0));
                      }
seems to fix the scrolling behaviour
BUT the heading shows BEHIND the scrolling list

2c  on android:id="@+id/heading"
    change alpha to android:alpha="1"
    add android:elevation="1dp".

extra notes:
probably would be better to insert a transparent spacer with the same size as heading?
  But frankly this seems to be enough for me!
ALSO .. the gap at the top seems to be "FIXED" , changing the sizes of text size or padding leaves gaps or overlaps
  this suggests a hardcoded value somewhere .. though I can't find it!
  Most likely in HeadingListView has adjusted padding
